# StudyBot
MVHacks Oct 21

A chatbot that will help students learn and practice academic subjects, along with helping them do their homework. It currently can only help students with math, but we plan on expanding its abilities and making it able to help in other subjects as well, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and english. This chatbot can be used by teachers as well. Teachers can create final exams online, and their students can take the tests online, eliminating the need of paper.
